# hotel_booking_final_project

Final project for the Person Oriented Multivariate Statistical Methods course

The dataset we are going to analyze is “Hotel Booking”. This dataset contains hotel booking information from two hotels in Portugal. Research problem: Canceled reservations or no shows are a waste of resources for the hotels. The aim is to predict the fulfillment of the booked reservation in order to provide recommendations to the hotels to have higher changes of fulfillment of the reservation
